# Contributing to Prompt Engineering Scenarios

## üåü We Welcome Your Contributions!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Prompt Engineering Scenarios! This is an open-source project, and we value all forms of contribution - from creating new prompts to improving existing ones, reporting issues, or suggesting enhancements.

### Why Contribute?
- Help build a valuable resource for the developer community
- Improve your prompt engineering skills
- Get recognition for your contributions
- Collaborate with other professionals in the field

### How You Can Help
- **New Contributions**: Add prompts for scenarios we haven't covered
- **Improvements**: Enhance existing prompts with better structure or content
- **Examples**: Provide real-world examples of prompt usage
- **Documentation**: Help improve our guides and documentation
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues or inconsistencies you find

This guide will help you contribute effectively to our growing collection of development prompts.

## ü§ù Types of Contributions

### High-Impact Contributions
- **New Scenario Prompts**: Add prompts for development contexts we haven't covered
- **Real Examples**: Share actual AI outputs and resulting code from using these prompts
- **Improved Prompts**: Enhance existing prompts based on real-world usage

### Valuable Contributions
- **Documentation**: Improve guides, add FAQs, create tutorials
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues with existing prompts or documentation
- **Use Case Studies**: Share how these prompts worked (or didn't) in practice

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Adding a New Prompt
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-[scenario-name]-prompt`
3. Use the template: Copy `/templates/new-prompt-template.md`
4. Follow the pattern: Role ‚Üí Behaviors ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Verification
5. Add to README: Update the main table with your new scenario
6. Submit PR: Include example usage and rationale

### Improving Existing Prompts
- **Test first**: Use the prompt with AI and document issues
- **Small changes**: Focus on specific improvements rather than complete rewrites
- **Maintain format**: Keep the CVP+ARL structure intact
- **Update examples**: If you change verification criteria, update examples too

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Prompt Quality Standards
‚úÖ **Good Prompts**:
- Address real development scenarios
- Follow the CVP+ARL methodology
- Include specific, actionable verification criteria
- Are tested with actual AI models
- Have clear, unambiguous language

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- Generic "code better" advice
- Overly complex verification checklists
- Scenarios that overlap significantly with existing prompts
- Language that's too academic or theoretical

### Content Standards
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - All code examples must be functional
  - Prompts must work with mainstream AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
  - Follow existing naming conventions and file structure

- **Documentation Standards**:
  - Use clear, concise language
  - Include practical examples
  - Follow the established markdown formatting
  - Proofread for grammar and spelling

## üîç Review Process

### What We Look For
- **Practical Value**: Does this solve a real problem developers face?
- **Quality**: Is the prompt well-structured and tested?
- **Uniqueness**: Does it fill a gap not covered by existing prompts?
- **Maintainability**: Is it clear and easy for others to understand/modify?

### Review Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Full Review**: Within 1 week
- **Merge Decision**: Within 2 weeks

## üéØ Contribution Ideas

### High-Priority Needs
- DevOps/Infrastructure prompt for deployment and monitoring concerns
- API Development prompt focused on REST/GraphQL design
- Mobile Development prompt for iOS/Android specific considerations
- Performance Optimization prompt for improving existing systems

### Medium-Priority Needs
- Code Review prompt for systematic code analysis
- Technical Debt prompt for refactoring legacy systems
- Documentation prompt for generating technical documentation
- Testing Strategy prompt for comprehensive testing approaches

### Examples Needed
- Real outputs from each scenario type
- Before/after comparisons showing prompt effectiveness
- Failed examples and lessons learned

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VIKAS9793/prompt-engineering-scenarios
cd prompt-engineering-scenarios
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

### File Naming Conventions
- **Prompts**: kebab-case.md (e.g., api-development.md)
- **Examples**: Match the prompt name (e.g., /examples/api-development/)
- **Documentation**: Descriptive names (e.g., troubleshooting.md)

### Testing Your Prompt
Before submitting, please:
1. Test with at least 2 different AI models
2. Try 2-3 different programming problems
3. Verify the verification checklist actually catches issues
4. Document any limitations or edge cases
